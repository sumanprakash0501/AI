My Name is Suman Prakash. I am a Data Analyst, QA, Writer and entrepreneur. I developed a keen interest in Artificial intelligence.
And, exploring the field. 
My native place is Patna, Bihar in India. However, I have an urge for exploring the world. And keep exploring the places whenever I get some time from learning and working.
I have also became a father of twin daughters, recently. And, enjoying the fatherhood at the moment.
